## 🧠 The Problem

Randomness on-chain is still broken:

- ❌ **Chainlink VRF**: centralized oracle dependency  
- ❌ **Blockhash entropy**: manipulatable and non-reproducible  
- ❌ **ZK rollups**: require transparent, traceable Keccak ops for proof generation  
- ❌ **Lack of tooling**: no open engine exists to **observe**, **trace**, and **verify** the entropy lifecycle  

> No modular, verifiable **Keccak sponge system** exists for smart contracts or ZK circuits. Until now.

---

## ⚙️ The Solution — **KeccakBlackBox Engine**

- ✅ **Commit–Reveal Entropy Feed**: Contributors inject entropy trustlessly  
- ✅ **Keccak Sponge Tracing**: Logs every step (absorb, pad, permute)  
- ✅ **SNARK-Ready Output**: Generates proof-friendly traces for ZK circuits  
- ✅ **Merkle-Based Inclusion Proofs**: Verifiable entropy origins  
- ✅ **Modular Shards**: Offload entropy/logs to on-chain containers  

> A minimal, composable system for traceable randomness — compatible with **circom**, **Noir**, **Risc0**, **zkWASM**, and beyond.

## 🧱 System Architecture

### 🔧 Core Mechanics
- `commitEntropy(bytes32)` → User commits entropy hash  
- `revealEntropy(bytes)` → User reveals entropy and pays fee  
- `_feedEntropy(bytes)` → Keccak sponge processing (step-wise)  
- `getTraceRoot()` → Generates SNARK-verifiable hash trace  
- `deployShard()` → Launches lightweight storage for entropy fragments  
- `verifyLeaf()` → Validates source inclusion via Merkle proof

---

## 🧪 Design Principles

- **Traceability First** — Every byte of entropy is observable  
- **Minimal & Modular** — Built for reuse across rollups, DAOs, zkApps  
- **Self-Contained** — Runs entirely on-chain, no oracle dependency  
- **ZK-Forward** — Structured for zero-knowledge proof integration

## 🚀 Roadmap

### ✅ v0 — **Live Now**
- Deployed to **Arbitrum One**  
- Verifiable entropy commit–reveal system  
- Full Keccak trace logging engine  
- SNARK-compatible trace output

### 🛠 v1 — **Coming**
- Dev CLI + SDK  
- Frontend portal for entropy commits & trace inspection  
- Circuit templates for proof verification (circom, Noir)

### 🌌 v2 — **Vision**
- Trustless entropy **oracle protocol**  
- Native support in **modular rollups**, **zk games**, **DAOs**  
- Cross-chain trace transport & **entropy bridges**

## 🎯 Why This Matters Now

- The decentralized stack needs **trustless randomness**  
- ZK rollups need **reproducible hash traces**  
- Developers need **composable entropy engines**  
- There are no other projects building this layer of infrastructure  

> This is the foundation layer for **verifiable autonomy** in smart contracts and zk-native apps.

## 🙋 How to Get Involved

- 💸 Sponsor a 6-month dev sprint  
- 🛠 Help build the SDK, frontend, or zk circuits  
- 🔗 Connect with zk founders, L2 teams, and cryptography researchers
