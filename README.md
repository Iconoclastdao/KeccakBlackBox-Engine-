# 🔒 KeccakBlackBox Engine  
### Verifiable Entropy & Traceable Hashing for Smart Contracts  

> The modular entropy engine for SNARKs, dApps, and autonomous systems.  
> Built by a solo developer. Live on Arbitrum. Verified & deployed at:

## 🧠 Problem  

Web3 relies on randomness, but it's fragile:

- ❌ **Chainlink VRF**: centralized, costly, external dependency  
- ❌ **On-chain randomness**: manipulatable, lacks verifiability  
- ❌ **ZK circuits**: need traceable, reproducible Keccak (not trivial)  
- ❌ **No modular engine** exists to trace, verify, and prove Keccak entropy flow  

> There is no **trustless entropy engine** that supports both smart contracts *and* ZK systems.

---

## ⚙️ Solution — **KeccakBlackBox Engine**

✅ **Entropy-as-a-Service** – commit/reveal + fee-based model  
✅ **Traceable Keccak Sponge** – step-by-step internal state logging  
✅ **SNARK Trace Output** – exportable Keccak sponge trace for ZK proofs  
✅ **Merkle Proofs** – verifiable inclusion of entropy input  
✅ **Modular Shards** – deployable containers for trace data, logs, or entropy state

> Deployed on **Arbitrum One**, modular by design, ZK-ready out the box.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### 🔧 Core Modules

- `commitEntropy(bytes32)` – Anti-frontrun commitment system  
- `revealEntropy(bytes)` – Entropy feed with verification and fee  
- `SpongeStepTrace` – Logs internal state (before, absorb, permute)  
- `MerkleRoot` – Validates entropy source/inclusion  
- `deployShard()` – Shardable lightweight storage containers  
- `getTraceRoot()` – SNARK-compatible Keccak trace tree  

### 🧪 Design Philosophy

- Auditability > randomness  
- Modularity > monolith  
- Infra layer for: ZK rollups, verifiable games, autonomous DAOs  
- Built in Solidity — targets **circom**, **Noir**, **Risc0**, **zkWASM**

## 🚀 Roadmap

### ✅ v0 – Today
- [x] PoC deployed on **Arbitrum One**
- [x] Full tracing engine & commit-reveal entropy model

### 🛠 v1 – Next
- [ ] Frontend CLI / Dev Portal / SDK  
- [ ] ZK circuits for trace verification  
- [ ] Browser tool for entropy visualization

### 🌌 v2 – Vision
- [ ] Protocol-level **entropy oracle**
- [ ] Plug-and-play support for **ZK rollups**, **L2 games**, **modular DAOs**
- [ ] Cross-chain **entropy bridging + trace exports**

---

## 🎯 Why Now

- ZK rollups, games, and DAOs all require **native, provable entropy**
- Arbitrum and other rollups are **missing core infrastructure primitives**
- There are **no competitors** building modular Keccak trace engines
- This is the **missing link** for fully autonomous smart contracts and zkApps

## 🙋 Ask

🔹 Backing for 6-month dev runway  
🔹 Support building dev tools + frontends  
🔹 Intros to ZK projects, modular rollups, and ecosystem funds
