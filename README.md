# 🔒 KeccakBlackBox Engine  
## Verifiable Entropy & Traceable Hashing for Smart Contracts

 solo developer building KeccakBlackBox Engine, a modular, on-chain entropy and hashing system designed for SNARK compatibility and trustless randomness. It’s deployed and verified on Arbitrum One: 0x5E554947137A0dC0c153D3BA6542e2d34E68CF06.


> *The modular entropy engine for SNARKs, dApps, and autonomous systems.*

## 🧠 Problem

Web3 relies on randomness, but it's fragile:

- **Chainlink VRF**: centralized, costly, external dependency  
- **On-chain randomness**: manipulatable, lacks verifiability  
- **ZK circuits**: need traceable, reproducible Keccak (not trivial)  
- **No modular engine** exists to trace, verify, and prove Keccak entropy flow

> *No trustless entropy engine supports both smart contracts and ZK systems.*

---

## ⚙️ Solution

### ✅ **KeccakBlackBox Engine**

- **Entropy-as-a-Service**: commit/reveal + fee-based model  
- **Traceable Keccak Sponge**: step-by-step logging  
- **SNARK Trace Output**: exportable hash trace  
- **Merkle Proofs**: verify entropy inclusion  
- **Modular Shards**: scalable storage containers for logs or snapshots

> *Built on Arbitrum. Deployable anywhere. Fully modular.*

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

**Core Modules:**

- `commitEntropy(bytes32)`: Anti-frontrun commitment system  
- `revealEntropy(bytes)`: Entropy feed w/ payment + verification  
- `SpongeStepTrace`: Internal state logger (before, absorb, permute)  
- `MerkleRoot`: Proof-of-entropy validation  
- `ShardDeployer`: Lightweight on-chain storage containers  
- `getTraceRoot()`: SNARK-friendly Keccak trace hash

**Design Philosophy:**

- Built for auditability, reproducibility, and modular use  
- Works as a **standalone oracle**, **library**, or **backend** for ZK circuits  
- Written in Solidity. Designed for SNARK stack (circom, Noir, Risc0)

## 🚀 Roadmap & Why Now

**v0 (Now):**  
✅ PoC completed on Arbitrum  
✅ Step-by-step tracing engine + entropy system  

**v2 (Vision):**  
⚡ Protocol-level entropy oracle  
🎮 Plug-and-play for games, rollups, DAOs  
🔗 Bridge randomness across chains

---

## 🎯 Why Now

- **ZK ecosystems** are exploding  
- **Rollups and modular chains** need native verifiable entropy  
- **No competitors** are building modular Keccak trace machines  
- Arbitrum + Ethereum need **infra devs building primitives** like this

---

## 🙋 Ask

- 🔹 Backing for 6-month dev runway  
- 🔹 Support building frontend + SDK  
- 🔹 Intros to ZK rollup teams & ecosystem grants

> We're building the **missing link** between trustless entropy, zero-knowledge, and smart contract autonomy.
